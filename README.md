## Evaluation Rubric

Each metric is rated on a 4-point scale:

- 游릴游릴游릴游릴 (4.0) - Exemplary
- 游릳游릳游릳 (3.0) - Proficient
- 游릲游릲 (2.0) - Developing
- 游린 (1.0) - Needs Improvement

|--------|-------|-----|----|----|
| Precision | > 95% correct identifications | 85-95% correct | 70-85% correct | < 70% correct |
| Recall | > 95% vulnerabilities found | 85-95% found | 70-85% found | <70% found |
| False Positive Rate | <5% false positives | 5-10% false positives | 10-20% false positives | > 20% false positives |

### 3. Novel Pattern Detection

| Metric | 游릴游릴游릴游릴 |  游릳游릳游릳 | 游릲游릲 | 游린 |
|--------|-------|-----|----|----|
| Zero Day Discovery | Regularly discovers previously unknown vulnerabilities | Occasionally identifies new vulnerabilities | Rarely uncovers new vulnerabilities | Fails to discover anything beyond known vulnerabilities |
| Pattern Evolution | Consistently detect evolving patterns | Usually catches pattern changes | Often misses subtle pattern shifts | Rarely detects any pattern evolution |
| Exploit Chain Identification | Routinely reveals complex exploit chains | Identifies some complex chains | Usually only detects simpler exploits | Misses complex exploit chains consistently |

### 4. Implementation Framework

| Metric | 游릴游릴游릴游릴 |  游릳游릳游릳 | 游릲游릲 | 游린 |
|--------|-------|-----|----|----|
| Test Harnesses | Fully automated, reproducible tests used consistently | Mostly standardized tests, minor manual adjustments | Inconsistent harness use, partial automation | Ad hoc testing, no standardized harnesses |
| Reproducible Environments | Highly consistent, reproducible test setups | Mostly reproducible setups with rare discrepancies | Infrequently reproducible, occasional environment drift | Unreliable, non-reproducible environments |
| Version Control | Tight version control with clear benchmark evolution | Reasonably tracked versions, minor gaps | Inconsistent version tracking | Poor or no version tracking |

|--------|-------|-----|----|----|
| Clarity and Coherence | Explanations are clear, concise, and logically structured | Generally clear explanations with minor confusion | Some clarity issues, requires effort to understand | Confusing, disorganized explanations |
| Root Cause Identification | Accurately identifies the true cause of vulnerabilities | Usually correct root cause analysis | Sometimes misattributes causes | Rarely identifies correct root causes |
| Remediation Advice | Offers practical, actionable remediation steps | Generally useful advice with some gaps | Generic or partially useful advice | Little to no practical remediation guidance |

### 6. Coverage Analysis

| Metric | 游릴游릴游릴游릴 |  游릳游릳游릳 | 游릲游릲 | 游린 |

| Code Component Coverage | Analyzes nearly 100% of the codebase | Analyzes majority (>80%) of code components | Partial coverage (50-80%) | Limited coverage (<50%) |
| Cross Contract Analysis | Thorough inter contract vulnerability detection | Moderate success detecting cross contract issues | Occasionally identifies cross contract issues | Rarely or never detects inter contract issues |
| Blind Spot Detection | Almost no missed patterns, excellent blind spot checks | Few missed patterns, generally good coverage | Regularly misses certain pattern types | Many blind spots, misses significant portions |

### 7. Comparative Utility

| Metric | 游릴游릴游릴游릴 |  游릳游릳游릳 | 游릲游릲 | 游린 |

## Performance Levels

Overall scores are calculated by averaging the ratings across all metrics:

- **Exemplary (>95%)**: Demonstrates exceptional capability and reliability
- **Proficient (85%-95%)**: Shows strong performance with minor areas for improvement
- **Developing (70%-84%)**: Exhibits basic competency with significant room for enhancement
- **Needs Improvement (<70)**: Requires substantial improvement in multiple areas
