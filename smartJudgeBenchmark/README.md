# **Automated Judging of LLM-based Smart Contract Security Auditors**



## Scoring System

Each metric is rated on a 4-point scale:

- 游릴游릴游릴游릴 (4.0) - Exemplary
- 游릳游릳游릳 (3.0) - Proficient
- 游릲游릲 (2.0) - Developing
- 游린 (1.0) - Needs Improvement


## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Vulnerability Detection

| Metric | 游릴游릴游릴游릴 |  游릳游릳游릳 | 游릲游릲 | 游린 |
|--------|-------|-----|----|----|
| Precision | > 95% correct identifications | 85-95% correct | 70-85% correct | < 70% correct |
| Recall | > 95% vulnerabilities found | 85-95% found | 70-85% found | <70% found |
| False Positive Rate | <5% false positives | 5-10% false positives | 10-20% false positives | > 20% false positives |
| Detection Coverage | Covers all known vulnerability types | Covers most (> 80%) known types | Partially covers (50-80%) known types | Covers few (< 50%) known types |

### 2. Advanced Efficiency

| Metric | 游릴游릴游릴游릴 |  游릳游릳游릳 | 游릲游릲 | 游린 |
|--------|-------|-----|----|----|
| Resource Utilization | Minimal overhead at all complexity levels | Slight overhead at higher complexities | Noticeable overhead at moderate complexities | Significant overhead even at low complexity |
| Multi-Contract Scaling | Near linear scaling, negligible degradation | Moderate performance degradation at large scale | Significant degradation at moderate scale | Severe degradation early on |
| Memory Optimization | Consistently low memory footprint | Occasionally spikes under heavy load | Frequent moderate memory spikes | Persistent high memory usage |
| API Call Efficiency | Minimal calls per contract, highly optimized | Slightly above minimal calls | Moderate overhead in API calls | Excessive and inefficient API calls |

### 3. Novel Pattern Detection

| Metric | 游릴游릴游릴游릴 |  游릳游릳游릳 | 游릲游릲 | 游린 |
|--------|-------|-----|----|----|
| Zero Day Discovery | Regularly discovers previously unknown vulnerabilities | Occasionally identifies new vulnerabilities | Rarely uncovers new vulnerabilities | Fails to discover anything beyond known vulnerabilities |
| Pattern Evolution | Consistently detect evolving patterns | Usually catches pattern changes | Often misses subtle pattern shifts | Rarely detects any pattern evolution |
| Exploit Chain Identification | Routinely reveals complex exploit chains | Identifies some complex chains | Usually only detects simpler exploits | Misses complex exploit chains consistently |
| Attack Vector Prediction | High accuracy in forecasting likely attacks | Moderate predictive accuracy | Limited predictive capability | Poor or no predictive accuracy |

### 4. Implementation Framework

| Metric | 游릴游릴游릴游릴 |  游릳游릳游릳 | 游릲游릲 | 游린 |
|--------|-------|-----|----|----|
| Test Harnesses | Fully automated, reproducible tests used consistently | Mostly standardized tests, minor manual adjustments | Inconsistent harness use, partial automation | Ad hoc testing, no standardized harnesses |
| Reproducible Environments | Highly consistent, reproducible test setups | Mostly reproducible setups with rare discrepancies | Infrequently reproducible, occasional environment drift | Unreliable, non-reproducible environments |
| Version Control | Tight version control with clear benchmark evolution | Reasonably tracked versions, minor gaps | Inconsistent version tracking | Poor or no version tracking |

## Performance Levels

Overall scores are calculated by averaging the ratings across all metrics:

- **Exemplary (>95%)**: Demonstrates exceptional capability and reliability
- **Proficient (85%-95%)**: Shows strong performance with minor areas for improvement
- **Developing (70%-84%)**: Exhibits basic competency with significant room for enhancement
- **Needs Improvement (<70)**: Requires substantial improvement in multiple areas
